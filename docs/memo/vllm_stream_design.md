# vLLM streaming prefill for AppCorr (`appcorr/vllm_stream/`)

Status: prototype on `develop/vllm-stream`, vLLM 0.11.2 (env `openrlhf_base`), in-process engine
core, TP=1, Qwen2.5-VL as the first model. No vLLM fork: four monkey-patched hooks + a scheduler
subclass, installable as a `vllm.general_plugins` entry point.

## What it is

AppCorr's streaming arm (`offload/server/model/qwen25vl_executor.py`, `llm_schedule="streaming"`)
prefills the causal LLM over vision embeddings *as they are corrected*, round by round, with the
text once at the end. In a serving engine that is a request whose prompt embeddings **arrive in
chunks**: open with chunk 0, append chunks, mark the last one final, sample only then. Every
prompt row is prefilled exactly once (append-only) -- the chunked/new-only vision correction
never rewrites a row the LLM already consumed, so Stream2LLM's LCP + invalidate "update mode" is
not needed and not implemented.

## Mapping onto vLLM v1

| concern | stock vLLM 0.11.2 | here |
|---|---|---|
| prompt data | `prompt_token_ids` xor `prompt_embeds` (`--enable-prompt-embeds`) | embeds only, per chunk |
| message | `EngineCoreRequest` | same struct; `trace_headers["x-appcorr-stream"]` = `open`/`oneshot`/`append`/`final`, M-RoPE positions of the chunk as JSON in `x-appcorr-mrope` (+ `-delta`) |
| engine entry | `EngineCore.preprocess_add_request` -> `Request`; `add_request` -> scheduler | patched: `open` -> `StreamingRequest`; `append`/`final` -> `StreamAppend` -> `StreamingScheduler.stream_append` |
| growth | -- | `StreamingRequest.stream_append`: cat `prompt_embeds`, extend `_all_token_ids` by `[0]*t`, `num_prompt_tokens += t`, cat mrope |
| "don't sample yet" | sampling happens when the request's last token is computed | **hold-back-one**: `num_tokens = len(all) - 1` while open; the scheduler never schedules the last held row, so it never samples; the runner sees the full length and its stock `seq_len < num_tokens` discard handles logits |
| runner copy | `CachedRequestState.prompt_embeds/num_prompt_tokens/mrope_positions` fixed at `NewRequestData` | `SchedulerOutput.appcorr_stream_updates[req_id] = merged chunk`; patched `_update_states` cats them and evicts the request from `InputBatch` so the stock re-add path rebuilds its row |
| M-RoPE | `_init_mrope_positions` calls `model.get_mrope_input_positions(prompt_token_ids, mm_features)` -- crashes on an embeds-only prompt | client computes positions from the token skeleton (same model function, duck-typed features) and ships them per chunk; `NewRequestData.appcorr_stream` carries them at first schedule |
| KV cache | block table grows per scheduled tokens | unchanged (append-only ⇒ blocks only grow) |
| prefix caching | block hashing on token ids | disabled for streaming engines (embeds have no ids) |

Idle behaviour: an open request with everything-but-one computed presents `num_new_tokens == 0`
and the stock running loop `continue`s over it (no busy work, no sampling, blocks kept).

## Client (`client.py`)

`StreamingLLM` wraps `vllm.LLM(enable_prompt_embeds=True, enable_prefix_caching=False,
scheduler_cls=StreamingScheduler)` with `VLLM_ENABLE_V1_MULTIPROCESSING=0`. Chunks are turned
into `EngineCoreRequest`s by vLLM's own `Processor` (stock max_tokens/eos handling); `open` goes
through `LLMEngine.add_request` (registers the output-processor state), `append` straight to the
in-process engine core (`OutputProcessor.add_request` would reject the duplicate id).
`step()` = one engine step; the caller interleaves arrivals and steps.

`Qwen25VLComposer` builds the exact prompt vLLM would run (HF processor, same token skeleton --
checked against the stock request's `prompt_token_ids` in the gate), embeds text rows with the
model's embedding table and image rows with either the model's own vision tower or a supplied
`[image_len, D]` tensor (milestone 2: AppCorr's progressive tower), and gets M-RoPE positions
from the model's `get_mrope_input_positions`.

## Gate (`analysis/experiments/vllm_stream_gate.py`)

A stock image request vs B one-shot embeds vs C streamed (one chunk per step) vs C2 burst
(all chunks before the first step) vs D stock chunked prefill (`max_num_batched_tokens`,
separate engine): greedy tokens + per-token logprobs. Results:
`analysis/results/vllm_stream/gate_qwen25vl7b.json`.

## Known limits / next

* In-process only. `NewRequestData.appcorr_stream` and `SchedulerOutput.appcorr_stream_updates`
  are plain attributes; a multi-process core needs them as msgpack fields (or a side channel).
* `open` must set `max_tokens` (the Processor derives the default from the first chunk's length).
* Structured output / spec decode / async scheduling untested with streaming requests.
* Milestone 2: AppCorr vision (appcorr env, transformers 5) in a separate process, per-round
  merged embeds to the vLLM process over a socket; TTFT script with chunk-arrival timelines
  (stock = submit after the last chunk; streaming = append on arrival).
